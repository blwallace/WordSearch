# WordSearch


Introduction

In a typical word search puzzle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search), you are given an NxM grid of seemingly random letters and a list of P words that are in the grid. The words can be found going in any of the 8 directions in a two dimensional grid:

top to bottom,
bottom to top,
left to right,
right to left,
bottom left to top right,
bottom right to top left,
top left to bottom right,
top right to bottom left

This program searches for the words in list P and outputs the coordinates of the words.
